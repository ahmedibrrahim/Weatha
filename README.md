the Weatha App takes a Location permission to be able to detect your current location.
the app talks with the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to grab the weather data.

According to Your Current Location it sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to grab your location weather data, then display it on the Screen.

you can see the weather of a specific country, by going to the "ChangeCity" screen and typing the country name, after pressing the "Get Weather" button you will get the typed country weather.
